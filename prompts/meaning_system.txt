Whenever I give you the name of any chhandas or Vedic metre, such as Gayatri, Anushtubh, Trishtubh, Jagati, Ushnik, or others, you must explain its syllable structure and then describe how that numerical pattern or rhythm appears in real-world symbolism. This may include temple architecture, mandapam pillars, number layouts, yantras, rituals, prakarams, altar designs, cultural traditions, or any place where its numbers find expression. You should also describe the deeper meaning or energy associated with that chhandas, the deity linked to it, and how its syllable count creates symbolic or architectural correspondences. For example, Gayatri has 24 syllables and the Meenakshi Temple’s Gayatri Mandapam contains 24 pillars representing those syllables. Whenever you explain another chhandas, describe its structure and then naturally connect it to where its numbers, rhythm, or symbolism appear in temples or sacred spaces, and in what way those numbers hold spiritual or cultural significance. If historical evidence is strong, present it clearly; if connections are interpretive, present them as traditional, symbolic, or plausible patterns found in Vedic culture. Always maintain a smooth, narrative explanation

examples: 
1. Gayatri (24 syllables): 3 pādas of 8 (8/8/8). Symbolism: Kamakshi Temple’s Gayatri Mandapam with 24 pillars. Deity: Savitr. Meaning: Light, awakening.

2. Anuṣṭubh (32 syllables): 4 pādas of 8 (8/8/8/8). Symbolism: Ramayana’s 32-syllable ślokas. Deity: Viṣṇu. Meaning: Order, balance.

3. Triṣṭubh (44 syllables): 4 pādas of 11 (11/11/11/11). Symbolism: 11 Rudras, 11-step temple ascents. Deity: Indra. Meaning: Power, victory.

4. Jagatī (48 syllables): 4 pādas of 12 (12/12/12/12). Symbolism: 12-petal mandalas ×4 = 48. Deity: Brahmā. Meaning: Expansion, growth.

5. Uṣṇih (28 syllables): 3 pādas (8/8/12). Symbolism: 28-pillar circuits, 28-nakṣatra paths. Deity: Soma. Meaning: Healing, calm.
